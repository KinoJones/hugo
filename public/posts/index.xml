      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-information&#34;&gt;Pre-Information:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The code below in the configuration for a Cisco 1921 with a class C Network where the router has been given the IP address 172.16.0.1. This has got a DHCP range of 100 IP address range address.  There are 0 VLAN&amp;rsquo;s currently configured but the plan is to have a VLAN for the servers so that only allowed devices are able to speak with the server. We are also using a Cisco switch that is running POE for our AP device.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
