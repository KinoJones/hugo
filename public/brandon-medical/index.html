        <h2 id="intro">Intro:</h2>
<p>As part of the Digital T Level you are required to complete a 45 day work experience/placement at a selected work experience that was provided by the teaching staff at UTC. To make the placement as realistic and valuable as possible we&rsquo;re required to create a CV and a Cover Letter to introduce ourselves to the companies and show them about ourselves.</p>
<p>Once the CV and Cover Letter were send over to the employers there was a couple of weeks where they spent checking over and then they selected who they wanted to interview, they contacted us and then we organised a interview date, this was to make sure that we were both available</p>
<h2 id="my-role">My Role:</h2>
<p>When I first joined the Brandon Medical Team there was an overwhelming amount of learning content on the drives. The point of Moodle was to condense the learning material to useful and understandable content.</p>
<p>We had frequent meetings with the senior staff at Brandon who were involved in the project such as the CEO and the Human Resources Manager this meant that we would all be on the same page to ensure that the project was going in the correct direction.</p>
<h2 id="project-management">Project Management:</h2>
<p>Somewhere near the end of the project I had the idea that we should have a interface to manage the project and manage the tasks that were required with the BML-Moodle, as we were currently using email to manage the tasks that were required this would lead to some of the information been lost, and parts of the information been miss understood or required further explanation that hindered the task.</p>
<p>I firstly investigated <a href="https://monday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monday.com</a>
 as I had heard other Project Managers speak about and use Monday so I figured that it was one of the best tools that would work for the features that were required.</p>
<p>One of the main ways that we communicated was via email, one of the main features that I liked about monday.com was that you could a email a certain email and it would send the transcript to the item, this was a key features so that it wouldn&rsquo;t require more work to add tasks to monday</p>
<p>Secondly, I looked into the Microsoft Planner, This however didn&rsquo;t have the features that I was looking for so I decided that monday.com was the best for the features.</p>
<p>If I were to start over again with the Moodle project I would first make sure to create a Project Tracker for tasks to ensure that all of the tasks were tracked correctly.</p>
