[{"categories":["Server","Networking","KVM","Virtual Machines"],"content":"Introduction Firstly, we installed Windows Server 2019 on the bare metal. As I wanted to learn more skills related to infrastructure it was essential that I could learn linux skills as well as windows skills. So, I spent a few days looking around at other solutions\nProxmox is a free and open source solution to virutalisation that offers that allows for the creation of virtual machines using any operating system. The first system that we built had 192 GB RAM and 24 cores.\nFirstly we wanted to make sure that the server could virtualise our Active Directory Domain Services and our file-server for retrieving regularly used files. Proxmox worked fine for this as we we\u0026rsquo;re able to run the machines that we need.\nWe used Windows Server 2019 to make the Active Directory Service and made the domain named tlevel.digital. Once I had setup the Static IP, I then made sure that the network was setup to hand out a the correct DNS server.\nI made a different Physical Virtual Machine to host the file-server so that the whole infrastructure could not go down if one of the VM\u0026rsquo;s goes down. I made sure that the server had a Static IP, if the server was getting an IP via DHCP then it might change if the IP Lease runs out. Then all of the machines that have mapped drives would need changing\nServer Hardware 192GB RAM 2x CPU 12 Cores Each 2 x 1GB On Board Networking 6x SATA Drive Days Fujitsu PCIE Raid Card 1x 240GB Kingston SSD 5x 480GB Kingston SSD ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/proxmox/","tags":null,"title":"Proxmox"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""}]
