      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had wanted to learn linux for the longest time but never really got the opportunity as in a learning situation Windows was the operating system that was used, then same for the work placement. Which ment I got really comfortable using the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Linux was something that interetsted me from the first time that I had looked into it as it was different from everthing else that I&amp;rsquo;d use before. I have previously used Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and am currently writing this from a Windows 11 machine. I would be daily driving linux on my Main Machine but there was some issues related to the graphics card that made it nearly impossible for that to happen&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To further my career and learning, and the installation of the Raspberry Pi Cluster. I looked into creating a bash script, that would automate the process as much as possible to reduce the amount of time that it took to setup and install all of the machines. Something that I would like to look into in the future is the addition of a deployment server that install the OS automatically across the network of machines. I currently have no idea how Iâ€™d go about doing that so using a bash based automated process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we installed Windows Server 2019 on the bare metal. As I wanted to learn more skills related to infrastructure it was essential that I could learn linux skills as well as windows skills. So, I spent a few days looking around at other solutions that ment I was able to learn more with the hardware and I stumbled across Proxmox.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Proxmox is a free and open source solution to virutalisation that allows for the creation of virtual machines using any operating system. Which ment we could host our Active Directory Service, Aswell as the networked storage solution that we use TrueNAS Scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We needed a safe fast and secure solution for storage. We need a solution that supported both Windows Shares (SMB) and Linux Shares. With the requirements that we need and the hardware that we have the search began. For the OS that was compatible with our older hardware and that worked with never drives that were harvested from our old college machines that were no longer in use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-choice&#34;&gt;Final Choice:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a few days searching and countless failed attempts to deploy a working server we found TrueNAS Scale and Core. After looking into the documentation for both of them. We found that it was not viable for use TrueNAS Scale as it ment we needed two boot drives this would have made the machines more redundant incase of a drive failure. For a long term solution this would have been much more viable. But we didnt not have the drive bays aviable for the space that we wanted. As the server only had 6 bays we decided to go for the TrueNAS Core which required us to have one boot drive. Which was perfect for our situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
