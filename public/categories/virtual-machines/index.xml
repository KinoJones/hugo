      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we installed Windows Server 2019 on the bare metal. As I wanted to learn more skills related to infrastructure it was essential that I could learn linux skills as well as windows skills. So, I spent a few days looking around at other solutions that ment I was able to learn more with the hardware and I stumbled across Proxmox.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Proxmox is a free and open source solution to virutalisation that allows for the creation of virtual machines using any operating system. Which ment we could host our Active Directory Service, Aswell as the networked storage solution that we use TrueNAS Scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
