      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We needed a safe fast and secure solution for storage. We need a solution that supported both Windows Shares (SMB) and Linux Shares. With the requirements that we need and the hardware that we have the search began. For the OS that was compatible with our older hardware and that worked with never drives that were harvested from our old college machines that were no longer in use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-choice&#34;&gt;Final Choice:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a few days searching and countless failed attempts to deploy a working server we found TrueNAS Scale and Core. After looking into the documentation for both of them. We found that it was not viable for use TrueNAS Scale as it ment we needed two boot drives this would have made the machines more redundant incase of a drive failure. For a long term solution this would have been much more viable. But we didnt not have the drive bays aviable for the space that we wanted. As the server only had 6 bays we decided to go for the TrueNAS Core which required us to have one boot drive. Which was perfect for our situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
