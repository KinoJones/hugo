## More Information
This part describe the Work Placement Requirement a little but more in depth if you aren't intersted in reading skip to Application to for information about the Placement.

As part of the Digital T Level it is essential that students are able to complete a work placement. This is vital as without Work Placement it is impossible to gain real on site skills. So the work placement is a vital part of the course. As there are so many skills that can't be learned in the classroom and you need be in a working environment to understand.

The work placement is a required 45 days but you are able to do more than 45 days if the company that you are placed with is happy with you completing more time. The whole point of the work placement is to ensure that students are gaining real world expereince.

We were give one day a week of college to complete the work placements, and after our exam period had finished on June 10th we were released to complete the work placement. This was a requirement to complete the course.

## Application and Interview
The aim of the work experience was to make it was real as possible, so firstly we were present with a few roles from Different companies including Hippo Digital, Asda, Leeds City Council and Brandon Medical.

After looking over all of the applications I felt that the Brandon Medical position was the best for me and was the best way that I could gain practical skills whilst also making a viable product that the company are able to use.

During the interview process Ingrid Law **(Human Resources Manager)** asked what kind of experience we we're looking to gain. I told Ingrid that I wanted as much exposure to the real world working environment as possible, and that meant that I'd be involved in meetings on the project and as possible.

## Project Introduction
Brandon Medical wanted a centeralised learning management system that would be used to train internal members of staff, Brandon's distributor's and finally the External Users, Client and Suppliers. The goal was to centeralised all of the learning material to a platform that is easy for all users. Brandon Medical had already investigated solutions that had the features that they wanted. After the inital meeting I looked into hosting Moodle at college on a virtual machine on your tlevel.digital.test server. This was a fairly easy solution as a lot of the installation is handled by the server. I choose to use a Windows Server 2019 backend and used XAMPP to install the services that were required. PHP, MySQL and MariaDB. These all came preinstalled and just required some extra configuration to work with Moodle.

## Future Updates
In the future I will share more information about the project, and share more indepth information about what we did. To create the Learning Management System
