## Intro:


## My Role:
When I first joined the Brandon Team


## Project Management:
Somewhere near the end of the project I had the idea that we should have a interface to manage the project and manage the tasks that were required with the BML-Moodle, as we were currently using email to manage the tasks that were required this would lead to some of the information been lost, and parts of the information been miss understood or required further explanation that hindered the task.

I firstly investigated [monday.com](https://monday.com/) as I had heard other Project Managers speak about and use Monday so I figured that it was one of the best tools that would work for the features that were required.

One of the main ways that we communicated was via email, one of the main features that I liked about monday.com was that you could a email a certain email and it would send the transcript to the item, this was a key features so that it wouldn't require more work to add tasks to monday

Secondly, I looked into the Microsoft Planner, This however didn't have the features that I was looking for so I decided that monday.com was the best for the features.

If I were to start over again with the Moodle project I would first make sure to create a Project Tracker for tasks to ensure that all of the tasks were tracked correctly.
